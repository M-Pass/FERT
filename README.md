# FERT
Facial Expression Recognition Test

The folder "FERT 1.0" contains the PsychoPy version of the test (built using PsychoPy 1.83.04, www.psychopy.org). 
Run the file "FER-T.psyexp" using PsychoPy to run the test. It will output a .csv file in the data subfolder. 

To score the test, run the file "FER-T 1.0 Scoring.R" using R (packages BEST and rstan are required for scoring) and open the .csv file when prompted. Computation may take a while (contact me, I may be able to carry it out for you). 

For any questions about the test and the scoring procedure, do not hesitate to contact me at marcello.passarelli@gmail.com
